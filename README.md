# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description 

I was motivatied to carry out this project to learn and document the steps taken in building a webpage. The code file of this webpage will be a reference point for me, on the basics of coding, until i have developed beyond this level. 
There were numerous instances of bugs that needed debugging and on a more amateur level, there were many simple mistakes that took some time to get to the bottom of. 
At the end of the day, it comes down to thinking in mathematical terms, grouping like-terms and giving them attributes that will present well on a screen.
